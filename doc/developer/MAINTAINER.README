Items for the Konsole maintainer:
=================================

A new maintainer may need super powers for some of these.  If so, put in a 
request.
http://sysadmin.kde.org/tickets/


A. New releases
    1. Update src/main.cpp for version  (2.7, 2.7.1, etc)
        a. Typically, Konsole is 2 versions behind KDE (KDE 4.7, Konsole 2.7)
        b. If no changes are made, don't increase version.
    2. Verify KDE bug site has all versions
        a. When a new x.y release is coming out, create the x.y and all x.y.z
            Example: 2.8, 2.8.1, 2.8.2, 2.8.3, 2.8.4, 2.8.5
        b. https://bugs.kde.org/editversions.cgi?product=konsole
            At the bottom there is an 'Add' link
    3. Once a x.y release comes out, in git master change version to x.y+1.999
        and add that to the Konsole BKO version.
        Example, 4.7 has been branched and git master is open again, change
        version to 4.7.999 in master.
    4. Usually the KDE release team handles the git tagging

B. Handbook
    1. For x.y release try to keep handbook up to date.
    2. Handbook is the index.docbook in konsole/doc/manual/

C. Sites
    1. konsole.kde.org is the only site the maintainer is responsible.
        a. It is currently in git (2012).
            https://projects.kde.org/projects/websites/konsole-kde-org
        b. If it becomes to much work or outdated, it might be forwarded to
            http://userbase.kde.org/Konsole

D. Mailing list
    1. https://mail.kde.org/mailman/admin/konsole-devel
        Password is given from previous maintainer (or someone who knows it).
        Robert Knight or Kurt Hindenburg
    2. As of 2013, all new subscriptions and first post require admin
        approval.  This was done to cut down on spam on the list. These
        options can be changed on the link in #1
