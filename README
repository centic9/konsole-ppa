Konsole - KDE's Terminal Emulator
==================================

Konsole is a terminal program for KDE.

As well as being a standalone program, it is also used by other KDE programs
such as the Kate editor and KDevelop development environment to provide easy
access to a terminal window. Konsole's features and usage are explained and
illustrated in the Konsole handbook, which can be accessed by browsing to
"help:/konsole" in Konqueror.
